## Description
**GitHub Lookup**

Website showcasing everything I learned in Epicodus week 1 of JavaScript. This application is to incorporate all the concepts taught this week by creating a program where the user can enter a GitHub username into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download/clone repository from https://github.com/alvindng/github-lookup
* Run postgres
* Run commands:
  * $ npm install
  * $ bower install
  * $ gulp build
  * $ gulp serve
* Create a Personal Access Token from Github:
  * Visit the Settings area of your GitHub account, select Personal Access Tokens from the sidebar, and hit Generate New Token.
  * GitHub will offer a list of options. Do not select any. These grant read/write permissions and access to personal data. Finally, select Generate Token.
  * Place your token in an .env file at the top level of your directory. Include .env in .gitignore file.
